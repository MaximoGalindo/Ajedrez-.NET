# ♟️ Chess in C#

This is a personal project I developed to practice and improve my programming logic using C#. It's a basic implementation of a chess game with a graphical interface, where pieces can be moved according to the fundamental rules of chess.

---

## 🧠 Why this project?

I chose to build a chess game from scratch to challenge myself with:
- The logic behind the movement of each piece.
- Turn-based mechanics.
- Valid move detection.
- Board structure and its representation in code.
- A simple graphical interface using Windows Forms.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Language:** C# (.NET Framework)
- **Environment:** Windows Forms
- **UI:** Images for the pieces, buttons for the board squares

---

## ✨ Features

- Valid movement logic for all chess pieces (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn)
- Enemy detection for capturing moves
- Turn alternation between white and black
- Visual representation of the board and pieces

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main objective of this project was not to implement every rule of chess (like check, checkmate, or castling), but rather to:

- Practice object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Use inheritance and polymorphism with chess pieces
- Validate logic in a challenging and practical context

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Ideas)

- Check and checkmate detection
- Move history and tracking
- Game reset option
- Better visual design for the board
- Basic AI to play against the computer
